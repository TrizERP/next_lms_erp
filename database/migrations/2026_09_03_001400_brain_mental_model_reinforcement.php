 * (read-only reference; that repository is not modified).
 *
 * Every table here is hpbrain_-prefixed. The Brain was designed to share a
 * database with the institute ERP, so nothing below collides with, alters or
 * duplicates an LMS table — Organization, Departments, People, Positions and
 * Students continue to live in the LMS's own tables and are reached through
 * hpbrain_entity_mappings.

/**
 * Ported verbatim from database/migrations/014_mental_model_reinforcement.sql.
 *
 * The SQL is kept as raw statements rather than rewritten into Schema
 * builder calls. That is deliberate: this DDL has been executed against a
 * live MySQL 8 server and carries three hard-won corrections that a
 * Schema-builder rewrite would silently undo —
 *   1. every table is hpbrain_-prefixed (the Brain shares a database with
 *      the institute ERP and must not collide with it),
 *   2. every id/foreign-key column is VARCHAR(36), because MySQL rejects
 *      TEXT in a key (error 1170),
 *   3. every ratio column states explicit precision, because a bare
 *      NUMERIC becomes DECIMAL(10,0) in MySQL and rounds confidence to an
 *      integer.
